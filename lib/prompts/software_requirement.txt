If it cannot be solved by code, return only False and do not add any more information.
If it can be solved by code, produce the high-level steps for the smallest seperate deliverable increments in the yaml format like below:

- DELIVERABLE: 1
  Solution:
    - Set up backend server using Node.js and Express framework
    - Create database schema using MongoDB for storing blog data
    - Implement API endpoints for creating, editing, and deleting blogs
    - Implement user authentication using Passport.js
    - Build frontend using React library for displaying blogs and interacting with API

  RUNTIME_INSTRUCTIONS:
    FILENAME: server.js
    RELIES_ON: package.json, client folder
    IS_LIBRARY: False
    LOCATION: root
    EXECUTION_ORDER: 1
    EXECUTION_COMMAND: npm start
    LANGUAGE: JavaScript
    ENV_VARS: N/A
    LIBRARIES: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React, Passport.js

- DELIVERABLE: 2
  Solution:
    - Add functionality for displaying a list of all blogs on the homepage
    - Implement pagination for displaying limited number of blogs per page
    - Implement search functionality for searching blogs by keyword

    RELIES_ON: server.js
    IS_LIBRARY: True
    LOCATION: root
    EXECUTION_ORDER: 2
    EXECUTION_COMMAND: N/A
    LANGUAGE: JavaScript
    ENV_VARS: N/A
    LIBRARIES: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React

- DELIVERABLE: 3
  Solution:

    FILENAME: comments.js
    RELIES_ON: blogList.js
    IS_LIBRARY: True
    LOCATION: root
    EXECUTION_ORDER: 3
    EXECUTION_COMMAND: N/A
    LANGUAGE: JavaScript
    ENV_VARS: N/A
    LIBRARIES: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React

- DELIVERABLE: 4

    RELIES_ON: comments.js
    IS_LIBRARY: True
    LOCATION: root

    LANGUAGE: JavaScript
    ENV_VARS: N/A
    LIBRARIES: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, React

Continue for as many deliverables as required, DO NOT include successive deliverables if they are not imported or connected.
Remember, each deliverable does not know about the other, so if imports, file reference or similar is required you need to mention it in the description.
Remember, each deliverable does not know about the other do not use same filename.
EACH filename must be connected via imports or references in the other files, the deliverables don't know about each other so you need to tell them what code to add to connect the other components. If DELIVERABLE: 1 filename is main.rb, DELIVERABLE: 2 filename is extraFunctionality.rb, then main.rb must import extraFunctionality and the same for successive deliverables.
The goal here is that the output file of each deliverable comes together into a single project folder with no duplication.
Note, the if a preferred languages is not given, use ruby, javascript and bash scripts, but not exclusive such as if building with html, css, etc.
Note: if the deliverable does not have a EXECUTION_COMMAND just put N/A
